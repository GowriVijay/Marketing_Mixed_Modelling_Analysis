In this statistical analysis I fitted a multivariate regression model on simulations of `Sales Volume` (response Variable) and marketing series data to (i.e. `Advertising`, `Distribution`, `Pricing`) to estimate the impact of various marketing tactics on sales and then forecast the impact of future sets of tactics.

The initial discovery of relationships is done with a training set while a test set is used for evaluating whether the discovered relationships hold.

Transformation and adjustment techniques are also applied (Adstocks, log-log, adding ordinal predictors) so that the data would meet the assumptions of the statistical inference procedure and to reduce the variability of forecasts.
